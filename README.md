# hw_smart_contracts
In this assignment we were tasked with creating three different smart contracts. Each contract was a little more challenging than the previous contract.
AssociateProfitSplitter was the first contract and it received ETH and split it evenly amoung three employees.
TieredProfitSplitter was the second contract and it received ETH and distributed it based upon the employee's position within the company.
The final contract was DeferredEquityPlan. The contract distributed shares based upon the employees tenure.
